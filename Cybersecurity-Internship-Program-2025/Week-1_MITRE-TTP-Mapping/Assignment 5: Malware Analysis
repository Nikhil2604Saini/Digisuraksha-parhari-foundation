 What is Malware Analysis?
Malware Analysis is the process of studying malicious software to understand:
How it works
What it does on a system
How to detect, prevent, or remove it
What indicators of compromise (IOCs) it leaves behind

It helps cyber defenders (Blue Team) in:
Threat hunting
Incident response
Writing YARA rules
Understanding attacker TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, Procedures)

🧰 Types of Malware Analysis
1. 🧊 Static Analysis (Without executing the file)
✅ Purpose:
To analyze the malware safely without running it — by inspecting its code, strings, headers, and structure.

✅ Common Tools:
Tool	Use
strings	Extract readable text from binary
peid / Detect It Easy (DIE)	Detect packers and compilers
exiftool	Extract metadata
sha256sum	Generate hash for malware sample
Ghidra / IDA Free	Disassemble and reverse engineer binaries

✅ Example:
bash
strings malware.exe
sha256sum malware.exe
2. 🔥 Dynamic Analysis (Executing malware in a safe environment)
✅ Purpose:
To observe the behavior of malware in real-time — such as:
Files it creates/deletes
Registry keys it modifies
Network connections it makes
Processes it spawns

✅ Safe Environments:
🛡️ REMnux (Linux distro for malware analysis)
🛡️ FLARE VM (Windows-based malware lab)
🛡️ Any.Run (Online sandbox — https://any.run)

✅ Common Tools:
Tool	Use
Process Explorer	View running processes
Procmon (Process Monitor)	Track registry, file, and process activity
Regshot	Take system snapshots before and after infection
Wireshark	Capture network traffic
Autoruns	Check for persistence mechanisms

🧭 Step-by-Step Workflow Example
🔍 Static Analysis:
Obtain hash: sha256sum malware.exe
Check for strings: strings malware.exe | less
